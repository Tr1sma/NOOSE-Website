/// <remarks>
/// The change protocol on /nachweis is open to every internal agent, and it filters by nothing but the entity type
/// the reader picks. Citizen correspondence is narrower than that: a ticket thread is leadership-only, and a tip
/// carries an anonymity promise. Both used to stay out of the protocol by accident — the interceptor captures field
/// values on Modified only, and every message row was a Created row until they became editable. This registry turns
/// that accident into a rule, on the write side, so no later reader of ChangesJson can undo it.
///
/// Scoped by type, not by field name: the same "Text" on a Comment is supposed to show its before and after.
