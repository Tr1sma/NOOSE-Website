/// Two copies of everything the public reads, one meaning each: Title/Teaser/DraftHtml are the working copy an author
/// may change at any time, ContentTitle/ContentTeaser/ContentHtml are what the outside world reads and are only ever
/// written by publishing. The headline is snapshotted too, unlike an editorial page: a release is a dated statement, and
/// a saved typo fix must not silently rewrite the headline that already went out.
/// <para>
/// <see cref="CaseNumber"/> is minted at the first publication and unique, so a draft has no public address at all
/// rather than a status that hides it. Unlike the page slug it may carry a database unique index: a counter number is
/// never reused, so a soft-deleted row can keep its own forever.
